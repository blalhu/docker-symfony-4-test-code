# Symfony 4.0 test on docker

The only reason of this project's existence is to test and demonstrate the [symfony4 docker repo](https://github.com/blalhu/docker-symfony4.0-php7.1). Probably more than 90% of the code you find here is comes from the [symfony/skeleton](https://github.com/symfony/skeleton) project.
